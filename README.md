Hozu Fitness is a smart fitness app I created that helps users train more effectively using form tracking, progressive workout programs, super beginner friendly design for easy navigation and breathing monitor.
Itâ€™s designed for both gym and calisthenic users, combining multiple fitness features into a single seamless platform. This Android application was developed using MIT App Inventor, featuring a simple block-based interface yet powered by complex underlying logic and algorithms.

Using this innovation, I won multiple competition.

I first participated in Young Innovator Challenge State level KL and won gold with my team Yi Feng and Bryan.
