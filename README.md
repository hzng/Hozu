## 🏋️‍♂️ Hozu Fitness — My Journey of Innovation

**Hozu Fitness** is a smart fitness app I developed to help users train more effectively through **form tracking**, **progressive workout programs**, and a **super beginner-friendly design** for easy navigation.  
It also features a **breathing monitor**, making workouts safer and more mindful.  

Designed for both **gym and calisthenics users**, Hozu Fitness combines multiple fitness tools into one seamless platform.  
This Android application was built using **MIT App Inventor** — simple in its block-based design, yet powered by **complex underlying logic and algorithms**.  

Using this innovation, I’ve had the opportunity to participate — and win — in multiple competitions across state, national, and international levels.

### 🥇 Young Innovators Challenge (State Level, Kuala Lumpur)

My journey began at the **Young Innovators Challenge (YIC) State Level** in Kuala Lumpur, where I led my team — **Yi Feng** and **Bryan**.  
We were awarded **Gold**, ranking among the **Top 3 teams** out of hundreds of participants across the state.  

This was my first major competition and the first time I led a team.  
It taught me not only technical and presentation skills but also **valuable leadership and teamwork lessons** that shaped how I approach innovation today.

### 🏕️ YIC National Level Finalist

After winning at the state level, my team was selected as one of the **Top 15 national finalists** among 60 state gold-winning teams.  
We attended a **one-week national innovation camp**, where I had the chance to connect with some of Malaysia’s brightest young talents — learning, competing, and exchanging ideas with them.

This experience opened my eyes to how vast and diverse innovation can be, and it motivated me to keep growing and pushing my boundaries.

Although we didn’t make it to the national Top 3, this setback became one of my greatest motivators.  
Instead of giving up, I set my sights higher — on the international stage.

### 🌍 World Youth Science & Innovation Invention (WYSII, Indonesia)

Together with my younger brother **Hong Shun**, we presented **Hozu Fitness 2.0** — a vastly improved version with new features and enhanced performance — at the **World Youth Science & Innovation Invention (WYSII)** held in **Medan, Indonesia**.  

The competition was fierce, featuring projects across all STEM fields.  
Despite the challenge, our hard work paid off — we were awarded **Gold**, marking our first **international victory** for Hozu Fitness.

### 💡 Reflection

From **state to international** stages, Hozu Fitness has been more than just an app — it’s been a journey of learning, resilience, and growth.  
Each stage taught me something new: how to lead, how to collaborate, and how to turn setbacks into opportunities.  

I continue to refine Hozu Fitness today, driven by the same goal that started it all — to make smart, accessible fitness technology that helps people train better and live healthier.
